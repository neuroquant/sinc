# Statistical Inference for Network Centrality \(SINC\)

In many applications such as functional neuroimaging and systems biology, we often infer biological networks from time-series or other non-network observations. Networks are then inferred using some form of statistical estimation for graphical models of statistical dependence. The simplest and most common instance of such networks are correlational networks. The SINC project seeks to enable rigorous statistical inferences on network centrality for covariance derived networks or more generally, any statistical dependence network. In particular, the objective of SINC is to modify known types of network centrality metrics to ensure the following objectives

1. **Numerical and estimation stability.** Thus making such metrics amenable to statistical inference via bootstrapping or subsampling
2.  **Generalizability** by appropriate standardization to ensure interpretable effect sizes in network centrality. Here, we are particularly concerned about ensuring interpretability for translational and clinical neuroimaging purpose.
3. **Reproducibility** by reducing researcher degrees of freedom by eliminating myriad variants of network centrality definitions and standardization options that are incompatibility scientific applications of interest.
